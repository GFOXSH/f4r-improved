Fallout 4 Radio for Wallpaper Engine

Original wallpaper created by Revan.

Improvements by GFOXSH:
* the clock now has a blinking dot, like an classic digital watch;
* radio tuning scale illumination now reacts to sound, like on old speakers with dry capacitors;
* buttons now can turn on/off the radio and change the music.
